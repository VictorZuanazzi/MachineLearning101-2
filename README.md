### Machine Learning 1, November 2018  
Notes on implementation:  
* You should write your code and answers in this IPython Notebook: http://ipython.org/notebook.html. If you have problems, please contact your teaching assistant.
* Please write your answers right below the questions. 
* Among the first lines of your notebook should be "%pylab inline". This imports all required modules, and your plots will appear inline. 
* Use the provided test cells to check if your answers are correct
* **Make sure your output and plots are correct before handing in your assignment with Kernel -> Restart &amp; Run All**  
* **If possible, all your implementations should be vectorized and rely on loops as little as possible. Therefore for some questions, we give you a maximum number of loops that are necessary for an efficient implementation. This number refers to the loops in this particular function and does not count the ones in functions that are called from the function. You should not go above this number for the maximum number of points.**
